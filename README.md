# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-using-C++:

Through this I learned how to make a simple TIC TAC game.

# Different steps to make this game:

1. Draw simple 3 by 3 matrix.

2. Make the input argument for two playes.

3. Set the winning logic like Raw, column and digonal wise condition.

4. Finally, implement matrix draw, input, and win function through main body.

I have attached output screen for better understand!
